## Hi, I'm Irshad Ullah 👋

I am an **MS Biotechnology graduate** with strong research experience in **whole-genome sequencing (WGS), genomics, and bioinformatics**. I have successfully assembled and analyzed the **whole genome of *Leishmania tropica***, with sequence data deposited in **NCBI**, and related manuscripts currently submitted/in-press.

My academic goal is to pursue a **PhD in Bioinformatics with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, applying computational methods to understand **genomic variation, pathogen biology, and data-driven biomedical research**.

This GitHub profile documents my journey toward that goal, including:
1. Genomic and NGS data analysis workflows  
2. Python- and R-based bioinformatics projects  
3. Reproducible research and ML-assisted analysis
